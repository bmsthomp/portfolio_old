        <p>Thanks for visiting my site. This a portfolio site that I have put together for myself. Below you will see a few of the projects that I have worked on along with a summarized Resume. If you are interested don't hesitate to send me an email with the 'Contact' section below. You can also contact me on LinkedIn or Twitter. </p>
        <p>I am currently a student at the University of Wisconsin Milwaukee. I will be graduating in December 2014 with a major in Information Science and Technology, a minor in Computer Science, a certificate in Web Development, and a certificate in Digital Arts and Culture. As you can see I have a wide range of skillsets and interests in the IT field. My passion lies with infrastructure and systems administration, but I am also deeply invested in web development. </p>
        <p>My work history accurately reflects my interests and skills. I have been working various jobs in IT since high school. My most notable positions were working as a Student Technician Supervisor and, more recently, working as a Web Developer. Along with these I have also experience working in Leadership and Project Management positions. The diversity in my work experience has allowed me to look at difficult problems that I am faced with from many different angles.</p>
        <p>Outside of work and school I am an avid traveler and love being outside. For my third year at university I studied abroad to Austria. From there I was able to visit many different countries and regions. I would count this experience as one of the most important things that I have done in my life.  I also have a passion for technology in my personal life. Working with technology is part of who I am and it finds its way into every aspect of my life. </p>
